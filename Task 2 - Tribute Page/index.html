        <p style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western
             India. He is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of his time 
             and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a part of the 
             folklore. With his valor and great administrative skills, Shivaji Maharaj 
             carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. 
             It eventually became the genesis of the Maratha Empire. After establishing 
             his rule, Shivaji Maharaj implemented a competent and progressive 
             administration with the help of a disciplined military and well-established 
             administrative set-up. Shivaji Maharaj is well-known for his innovative 
             military tactics that centered around non-conventional methods leveraging 
             strategic factors like geography, speed, and surprise to defeat his more 
             powerful enemies.
